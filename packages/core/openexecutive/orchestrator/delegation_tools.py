"""``ghostwrite_email``: write an email as the person you're speaking with, as a
draft in their own mailbox — Gmail or Outlook, whichever they've connected
(Act as me — see ``openexecutive.delegation``).

The one tool that writes under someone else's name, so it is fenced in code,
not in the prompt:

- **Offered** only when ``delegation.settings.pin_turn_delegation`` said so at
  the start of the turn (the speaker can have it, turned it on, and asked on a
  surface that verified it is them, in a conversation private to them; never
  an unattended or private-to-principal turn). It lives in its own registry,
  never ``_ALL_SKILL_TOOLS``, so no other toolkit (reflection, research,
  workflows) can ever carry it. The handler re-checks the pin and the surface
  anyway.
- **Capped**: 5 drafts a turn and ``DELEGATION_MAX_DRAFTS_PER_DAY`` a day per
  person, each slot taken before the first await (a round's calls run
  concurrently).
- **Recipients are chosen here**, never by the model: a reply goes to the last
  message's sender (never its ``Reply-To``), with the thread's other
  recipients only on ``reply_all``; a new email only to someone on the roster
  or an address the speaker typed this turn.
- **Drafts only.** It saves a draft in the person's own mailbox and sends nothing.
- **Private.** Before its first read of the mailbox it marks the turn
  (``TurnDelegation.touched_mail``): every audit row the turn writes from then
  on is private to the principal, and the turn teaches no memory — no
  episodic, open-loop, working-style or peer-memory pass runs on it.
